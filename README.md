## 🏗️ Task 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing

### 🔍 Methodology

#### 1️⃣ Web Scraping 🕸️

- Each review includes:
  - 📝 Review text
  - ⭐ Rating (1–5 stars)
  - 📅 Date
  - 🏦 Bank name
  - 🌐 Source ("Google Play")
- 📊 Collected **400+ reviews per bank** for a total of **1,200+ reviews**.

#### 2️⃣ Saving Raw Data 💾

- 💽 All reviews saved into a combined CSV file:  
  `data/bank_reviews_raw.csv`
- 🗂️ Additionally, separate CSV files for each bank:
  - `data/reviews_cbe.csv`
  - `data/reviews_boa.csv`
  - `data/reviews_dashen.csv`

#### 3️⃣ Preprocessing 🧹

- 🗑️ Removed duplicates based on review text, date, and bank.
- 🚫 Dropped rows with missing values in key fields.
- 🗓️ Normalized the date format to `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- 🧼 Final cleaned dataset saved to:  
  `data/bank_reviews_clean.csv`
